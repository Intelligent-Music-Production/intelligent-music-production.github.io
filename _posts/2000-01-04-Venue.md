#### Air links
Nearby airports include Bristol, Exeter, and (via Rail links) the major London airports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton, and London City).
Rail
The train station is just a few minutes' walk from the city centre and main University campus at Plymouth, where WIMP will be held. There is a regular train service from Plymouth to London Paddington which takes around three hours. This is the best service to connect with if you are travelling to WIMP via one of the London airports.

There are other direct services from Plymouth to South Wales, the Midlands, the North of England and Scotland. Train is the quickest and most convenient transport, but can be very expensive, depending when you travel.

#### Air and Rail
From Exeter there are several trains to Plymouth in most hours. 

From Bristol there are several train per hour.

From London Paddington there is one inter-city train per hour (note that the train that leaves around 1700 is always expensive), and there are some trains from London Waterloo, but the journey is longer than from Paddington, and you will have to change trains at Exeter. The most convenient way of crossing London is by tube. If you book a train from an airport to Plymouth via London, it should include the necessary Tube fare. If you are flying to Heathrow or Gatwick there are also specialist express trains which will take you from the airport to Paddington very efficiently (15 minutes from Heathrow to Paddington, 30 minutes from Gatwick to Paddington) - though fares for these services can be high.

For rail enquiries, call +448457484950 or visit [www.nationalrail.co.uk](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk) or [www.thetrainline.com](http://www.thetrainline.com).

#### Ferry
Brittany Ferries operate car ferry services between Roscoff (France) and Santander (Spain) and Plymouth. Fares can be high, especially in season, but are charged by the vehicle, so for a group sharing a car it can be a good deal (with no further travelling necessary in the UK). Visit [www.brittany-ferries.com](http://www.brittany-ferries.com)

There are other ferry services from France to ports further East (Weymouth, Poole, Portsmouth, Dover), but there are no direct highway connections with Plymouth, so you need to allow ample travelling time. Operators include [P&O](http://www.poferries.com), [AFerry.co.uk](http://www.aferry.co.uk) and [DFDS Seaways](http://www.dfdsseaways.co.uk).  

#### Car
The main route to Plymouth from the North is via the M5 motorway and then continuing on the A38 Expressway via Exeter. Leave the A38 at March Mills interchange and take the A374, which is clearly signed for the City Centre. From the West, leave the A38 at Manadon Interchange and take the A386 into the city. It's about a three and a half hour journey from London to Plymouth.   

In keeping with the University's environmental commitment, the use of cars by students, other than students with disabilities, is actively discouraged. In line with good environmental practice, the University charges for car parking on campus. Parking on campus is severely restricted, however, if visiting us, please contact the WIMP committee to enquire regarding visitor parking, on your behalf. Alternative parking can be found in the city centre. There are several car parks located within walking distance of the University.

A full list of car parks and their locations can be found on the [Plymouth City Council website](http://www.plymouth.gov.uk). 

The city centre also provides three park and ride facilities at George Junction (the largest capacity of the three), Milehouse and Coypool, running services Monday to Saturday. For further information please visit the Park and Ride section of the There are regular coach services from most major cities to Plymouth. The coach service from Bretonside Bus Station in Plymouth to London Victoria goes via Exeter and takes just four-and-a-half hours. The bus station is a few minutes' walk from the city centre and main University campus. National Express is the main coach operator from London airports to Plymouth: coach is inevitably slower but usually a lot cheaper than train. If you are really needing to count the pennies, Megabus (including Megatrain) may be a possibility.
